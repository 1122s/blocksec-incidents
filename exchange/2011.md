Exchange and Cryptobusiness Incidents - 2011
============================================

Incidents involving cryptocurrency exchanges, software companies, and other service businesses. Subscribe to [Blockchain Threat Intelligence](https://blockthreat.substack.com/) for news of the latest incidents.

The year was marked by the massive Mt. Gox user database compromise which contained a large number of unsaulted password hashes. These credentials were used to steal Bitcoin on not only Mt. Gox itself, but other websites such as MyBitcoin as well. One of the compromised Mt. Gox credentials had administrative privileges which was used to manipulate Bitcoin price and drop it to just 1 penny in what is now known as Flash Crash of 2011.
